# Minutes of Meeting - Task list

Task 1 - Downloading the MAVEN Satellite and Validation -   

- Download sts file for 2015-09-15 date from MAVEN satellite website-
	- Refer to "Introduction_for_Prasoon.pptx" for instructions
	- Plot one-day interval magnetic field components (Bx, By, and Bz planetocentric)
	    - Put the range of vertical axis of the plots to be (-20,20) nT (to be able to see the main magnetic field variations)
        - Plot the satellite trajectories - Y vs X, and Z vs X plots.
    - Obtain Nightside magnetic field plots by applying conditions:
        - X < 0
        - sqrt(Y**2 + Z**2) < |X|

Task 2 - Obtain Bx Nightside Crossing Points - 
    - Identify the points where plot crosses Bx = 0 line 
    - Separate the points such that crossing is not happening due to noisy nature of data
        - the crossing should be more or less symmetric around crossing point (like odd functions at origin)
        - a net monotonic trend should be seen in the curve, upto a certain range (example across 50 samples at least)
    - Two extremum points, enclosing the crossing point, should have magnitude between 3nT to 30nT (3nT < |Bx| < 30nT)
    - Plot the individual sub intervals containing the crossing points
    	- Clip the noisy parts at the ends of the sub-interval plots if possible
        
Task 3 - Converting to LMN Coordinates -
    - Refer to "Local magnetic field LMN coordinates.pptx" file for instructions and "artemyev2017_research_paper.pdf" for theory
    - Find the LMN coordinates for all the sub-interval plots
    	- Normalize the eigenvectors and use them to find Bl, Bm and Bn
    - Plot Bl, Bm, and Bn with Bx, By and Bz. Use different natures of plots to separate all of them
    - Repeat Task 1 to Task 3 for several different dates and obtain the above plots
    
Task 4 -
